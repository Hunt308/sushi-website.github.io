# sushi-website.github.io

One of my friends from Japan loves sushi and decided to make a menu that follows you around and have a smooth scroll that follows you around. 
It took me about 4 hours to make this website. I am very happy how the scroll turned out along with the animation with the photos and the grid and the speed I got it.

-First time using transform scale in css to make images bigger when hover -First time using max-width to make text run smoothly 
-First time using smooth scroll in html and css -First time using a fixed see through menu -First time using css grid for percentages of the items 
-First time making a contact form without looking up -First time using flexbox to align items property in the showcase 
-First time using IDs more -First time I picked a color scheme and drew it and planned it and worked. 
-First time using basic CSS animations. The wedding website was keyframes and transitions, but this was actual basic animations

made some hover and contact form colors that is darker and stands out more
